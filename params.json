{"name":"PyMatrixID","tagline":"Fast interpolative decompositions in Python","body":"PyMatrixID\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAn interpolative decomposition (ID) of a matrix is a factorization as a product of a skeleton matrix consisting of a subset of columns and an interpolation matrix containing the identity. Like the singular value decomposition (SVD), the ID is a powerful approximation tool. The principal advantages of using an ID instead of an SVD are that:\r\n\r\n- it is cheaper to construct;\r\n- it preserves the matrix structure; and\r\n- it is more efficient to compute with in light of the structure of the interpolation matrix.\r\n\r\nThe ID software package by Martinsson, Rokhlin, Shkolnisky, and Tygert is a Fortran library to compute IDs using various algorithms, including the deterministic pivoted QR approach and more recent randomized methods. PyMatrixID is a Python wrapper for this package that exposes its functionality in a more convenient manner. Note that PyMatrixID does not add any functionality beyond that of organizing a simpler and more consistent interface.\r\n\r\nPyMatrixID is freely available under the BSD license; for alternate licenses, please contact the author.\r\n\r\n**Note**: PyMatrixID has been merged into SciPy 0.13 (in a slightly modified form) as ``scipy.linalg.interpolative`` by Andreas Kl√∂ckner and Pauli Virtanen. It is highly recommended to henceforth use that package instead.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n- [HTML](doc/html/index.html)\r\n- [PDF](doc/PyMatrixID.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
